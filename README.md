In this project, we explore a dataset from the CORGIS Dataset Project that provides hospitals' rating measures information related to heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia, and hip-knee surgery, along with their location information. Our main objective is to predict the cost of a heart attack procedure based on different rating measures, facility type, and location. We used linear regression, feature selection methods, and data visualization techniques to analyze the data. Our results show that facility type and location are the most significant predictors of the cost of a heart attack procedure. We suggest using better performance metrics, such as cross-validation, to evaluate the models' performance. We also investigated into the relationship between heart attack care cost, heart attack care quality, and heart attack procedure cost.
